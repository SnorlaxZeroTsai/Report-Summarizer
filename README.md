# üß† Deep Research Agent

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is inspired by LangChain's `open_deep_research` and is customized for domain-specific research automation. It features task-tailored prompt engineering and a redesigned web search post-processing pipeline to control context size and ensure cleaner input for the Large Language Models (LLMs) during section generation.

A modular and automated research report generation tool designed for **in-depth topic analysis** using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), human-in-the-loop verification, and multi-agent LLM coordination. This project is built with [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) for structured and dynamic execution.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Before running, ensure you have created the necessary configuration files and environment variables.

### 1. `report_config.yaml` (Example)

This file controls the core parameters of the report generator. Create it in the root directory.

```yaml
# --- Example report_config.yaml ---
PROMPT_STYLE: "industry" # or "research"
PLANNER_MODEL_NAME: "gpt-4o"
BACKUP_PLANNER_MODEL_NAME: "gpt-4o-mini"
LIGHT_MODEL_NAME: "gpt-4o-mini"
BACKUP_LIGHT_MODEL_NAME: "gpt-4o-mini"
VERIFY_MODEL_NAME: "gpt-4o"
BACKUP_VERIFY_MODEL_NAME: "gpt-4o-mini"
MODEL_NAME: "gpt-4o"
BACKUP_MODEL_NAME: "gpt-4o-mini"
WRITER_MODEL_NAME: "gpt-4o"
BACKUP_WRITER_MODEL_NAME: "gpt-4o-mini"
CONCLUDE_MODEL_NAME: "gpt-4o"
BACKUP_CONCLUDE_MODEL_NAME: "gpt-4o-mini"
REPORT_STRUCTURE: |
  Use this structure and Traditional Chinese to create a report on the user-provided topic:

  1. Brief Summary (No Research Needed)
  2. Main Body Sections (With Subtopics and Research)
  3. Future Areas of Focus (No Research Needed)
```

### 2. `retriever_config.yaml` (Example)

This file configures the behavior of the local RAG retriever. Create it in the root directory.

```yaml
# --- Example retriever_config.yaml ---
# IMPORTANT: Update this path to point to your preprocessed data folder.
raw_file_path:
  - "/path/to/your/preprocessed_data/"
split_chunk_size: 1500
split_chunk_overlap: 250
embedding_model: "BAAI/bge-m3" # Recommended embedding model
top_k: 5
hybrid_weight: [0.4, 0.6]
```

### 3. `.env`

Create a `.env` file and fill in your API keys and service settings.

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your_deepseek_api_key"
REPLICATE_API_KEY="your_replicate_api_key"
TAVILY_API_KEY="your_tavily_api_key"
SEARCH_HOST="localhost" # Host for the Selenium scraping service
SEARCH_PORT="8000"      # Port for the Selenium scraping service
```

## üìÑ Advanced Information Retrieval

### PDF Processing Engine (`Utils/pdf_processor.py`)

This module provides a powerful PDF processing pipeline designed to convert unstructured PDF files into structured, RAG-optimized JSON data. It leverages LLMs to intelligently parse, analyze, and enrich content, making complex information within PDFs easily accessible to your agent.

### Audio Processing Engine (`Utils/audio_processor.py`)

(Under development...)

### Information Retrieval Strategy

Our RAG process is inspired by Ilya Rice's award-winning strategy, using a "small-to-large" chunking technique to provide LLMs with complete, coherent context for improved accuracy.

---

## üß™ Usage

### 1. Preprocess Local Data (Optional)

If you have local PDF or audio files to include in the retrieval, place them in a source directory (e.g., `data/raw_files/`). Then, run the preprocessing script:

```bash
python preprocess_files.py
```

This script will process the files and save the structured output. Ensure the output directory is correctly specified under `raw_file_path` in your `retriever_config.yaml` so the RAG pipeline can find the data.

### 2. Run Report Generation

#### Deep Report (`report_writer.py`)

This is the main, most feature-complete report generation workflow.

```python
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig
from State.state import ReportStateInput
from report_writer import graph, DEFAULT_REPORT_STRUCTURE

# Configure the execution
config = RunnableConfig({
    "thread_id": "your-research-id", # A unique ID for your research task
    "number_of_queries": 5,
    "use_web": True,
    "use_local_db": True,
    "max_search_depth": 3,
    "report_structure": DEFAULT_REPORT_STRUCTURE,
})

# Set the report topic
topic = "An in-depth analysis of supply chain challenges and opportunities in the global semiconductor industry as of Q1 2025..."
input_data = ReportStateInput(topic=topic)

# Start the graph execution
for event in graph.stream(input_data, config, stream_mode="updates"):
    if "__interrupt__" in event:
        # The process will pause here when user feedback is needed
        print(event["__interrupt__"][0].value)
        # Enter your feedback here to continue
```

#### Simple Report (`simple_report_writer.py`)

Use this script if you need to quickly generate a RAG-based report on a single topic.

```python
from simple_report_writer import graph
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig

# Configuration
config = RunnableConfig({
    "number_of_queries": 5,
    "max_search_depth": 3,
})
topic = "Please analyze TSMC's financial report for Q1 2024"
input_data = {"topic": topic}

# Execute
for event in graph.stream(input_data, config, stream_mode="values"):
    # Streams updates until the final report is complete
    final_answer = event.get("final_answer")
    if final_answer:
        with open("simple_report.md", "w") as f:
            f.write(final_answer)
```
